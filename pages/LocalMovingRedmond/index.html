            lb-props-coltxt="First of all, the packing and moving process is nothing but simple and easy. It sounds easy – packing up things and moving them in a rented truck, but considering that many families have accumulated a lot of belongings and valuable items, things can get a bit more complicated. Time can sometimes be very limited to finish the needed preparations for moving. Some items are too heavy or bulky for one, or even two people to move. And of course, people would rather cut themselves some slack and hire a moving truck and local movers to get their belongings to a new place."
